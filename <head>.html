    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>I am an energetic, ambitious person who has developed a mature, functional and responsible approach to any task <br>
      that I undertake or situation that I am presented with. I have managed to complete projects within the timeframe,<br>
      get good performance results and help promote the company’s vision as well as its strategy through marketing tactics.<br>
      Skills such as being proactive, a fast learner, a team player and communications are some that I have developed over <br>
      time and with experience.
    </p>
    <p>I am keen to explore the world of Marketing in digital, social or international. Digital marketing has become a necessity <br>
      and an advantage to get the desired result from every project. Keeping this in mind I decided to pursue MSc. Digital <br>
      Marketing (2022 – 2023) from a renowned institution, the University of Surrey to learn about the practical aspects, <br>
      trends and explore the field in depth. I am eager to learn more and gain as much on-the-job knowledge of how marketing <br>
      is applied in day-to-day tasks and would hope to continue my marketing journey in your marketing department.
